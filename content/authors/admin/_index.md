I am a researcher at Huawei Noah's Ark Lab, specialized in the cutting-edge fields of **Embodied AI** and **Reinforcement Learning** (RL). I am dedicated to researching embodied technologies including perception, planning, movement, and operation, and promoting the industrial application of embodied AI. I obtained a bachelor's degree in Marine technology from [Dalian University of Technology](https://www.dlut.edu.cn/)(DUT) and a Ph.D. degree in [Electronic Information from the Department of Precision Machinery and Precision Instrumentation, University of Science and Technology of China](https://pmpi.ustc.edu.cn/main.htm)(USTC). I also interned at the [Tencent Robotics X](https://ai.tencent.com/ailab/zh/index)(supervised by Dr. Zheng Yu and Dr. Huang Bidan). My research interests include body-intelligence, humanoid robots, reinforcement learning, robot motion planning and operation learning, etc. I also maintain a high level of interest and attention in fields such as robot simulation, data-driven, and multimodal large models.
