<br>I am a Research Scientist at [Institute of Artificial Intelligence (TeleAI), China Telecom](http://www.chinatelecom.com.cn) and the Director of Embodied AI research center, specialized in the cutting-edge field of **Embodied AI** and **Reinforcement Learning** (RL). Our group is dedicated to develop embodied technologies encompassing perception, planning, locomotion, manipulation, and promoting the industrial application of embodied AI. Our group thrives under the leadership of Prof. [Xuelong Li](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ahUibskAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN), who serves as the dean of TeleAI. Previously, I was a Researcher at [Shanghai AI Laboratory](https://www.shlab.org.cn/), affiliated with [IPEC group](https://www.pjlab-ipec.com/). My research interests include diffusion/transformer policy, LLM-driven planning, world model, preference learning, RL/MPC-based locomotion, dexterous manipulation, representation learning, sim-to-real, multi-agent collaboration, as well as real-world applications for robot arm, dexterous hand, quadruped robot, and humanoid robot.
<br><br>
I holds a Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from Harbin Institute of Technology ([HIT](https://www.hit.edu.cn/)), advised by Prof. [Peng Liu](http://pr-ai.hit.edu.cn/2018/0505/c10408a207376/page.htm). I am fortunate to have been collaborated with many fantastic researchers. I was a joint PhD student at [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/) and [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/), working with Prof. [Animesh Garg](http://animesh.garg.tech/). I also used to be an intern at [Huawei Noah's Ark Lab](https://www.noahlab.com.hk/#/home) (advised by Prof. [Jianye Hao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=FCJVUYgAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN)), [Tencent Robotics X](https://ai.tencent.com/ailab/zh/index) (advised by Dr. [Lei Han](https://leihan.org/)), and Alibaba. I received my Bachelor's degree and Master's degree in Computer Science from HIT.
