abstract: "This paper aims to explore the application of Bayesian deep reinforcement learning (BDRL) in robot manipulation tasks with sparse rewards, focusing on addressing the uncertainty in complex and sparsely rewarded environments. Conventional deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms still face significant challenges in the context of robot manipulation tasks. To address this issue, this paper proposes a general algorithm framework called BDRL that combines reinforcement learning algorithms with Bayesian networks to quantify the model uncertainty, aleatoric uncertainty in neural networks, and uncertainty in the reward function. The effectiveness and generality of the proposed algorithm are validated through simulation experiments on multiple sets of different sparsely rewarded tasks, employing various advanced DRL algorithms. The research results demonstrate that the DRL algorithm based on the Bayesian network mechanism significantly improves the convergence speed of the algorithms in sparse reward tasks by accurately estimating the model uncertainty."
